Instructors may want to "flip" their classroom with open educational
resources (OER), but finding resources that are field-tested in a
variety of settings and known to be high-quality is a challenge. The
CuratedCourses platform addresses this challenge by associating rich,
curated metadata with OER. More specifically, by aligning open content
to a carefully designed a tag hierarchy for linear algebra,
CuratedCourses assists linear algebra instructors in identifying
high-quality related resources. Students see related resources
automatically appear in the margin of their OER textbook. This
material is based upon work supported by the National Science
Foundation under DUE-1505246. (Received September 26, 2017)
