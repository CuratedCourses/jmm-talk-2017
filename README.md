Finding online math curricular resources that are readily available, field-tested in a variety of settings, and known to be
high quality is a challenge. CuratedCourses is an NSF-funded IUSE project to address that challenge.
CuratedCourses is an open platform where metadata is associated with educational content on the web, where experts
review the educational content, and where instructors can then find the vetted content aligned with popular textbooks
and course calendars. Challenges are locating high-quality content, developing rubrics for evaluating content, and creating
standard formats for tagging topics and learning outcomes. GitHub and other open technologies are used to address these
challenges. (Received August 15, 2016)
