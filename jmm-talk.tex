%Sad XML Truth No. 3: Interoperability isn�t an engineering issue,
%it�s a business issue.  Creating the Web -- HTTP plus HTML -- was
%probably the last instance where standards of global importance were
%designed and implemented without commercial interference. Standards
%have become too important as competitive tools to leave them where
%they belong, in the hands of engineers. Incompatibility doesn't exist
%because companies can't figure out how to cooperate with one
%another. It exists because they don�t want to cooperate with one another.
